          <br/>
          <div class="text-left">
          <p>As a .NET Developer at WPS Health Solutions I used Visual Studio 2017 to work on a variety of batch applications utilizing C# and VB.
            We followed an agile SDLC allowing us to ship bug fixes and enhancements quickly.  Through WPS, I was also able to obtain my Dell Boomi Professional Developer certificate and work
            on some Boomi applications.  Boomi is a low code integration platform. 
            </p>
            
            <p>In February of 2021, I transitioned into the role of Java Developer on our Government Health Administrators Portal team.  In this position, I was responsible for coding solutions based on requirements from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),
            enhancements requested by our internal clients, and refactoring Cobol MQ transactions to Java as part of our modernization effort.  Our portal consists of over a hundred REST Service endpoints and all the business logic to 
            support them.  Utilizing Postman, I created the necessary API calls to my local server to debug and comply with our code quality standards.

          <div class="text-left">
            <p>
              I am currently working as a contracted Full Stack Developer at Electronic Theater Controls.  My responsibilities include maintaining the visual, logical, and database code of multiple legacy web applications written in Java and C#, and acting as lead developer for any new enterprise applications that the business requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuous learning is important to me.  Outside of work I continue to enhance my skills in a variety of ways.  I am currently enrolled at Madison College in JavaScript Frameworks which focuses on Angular.  I try and apply the concepts I am learning to my <a href="https://pnorby.github.io/rent-a-car">car-rental demo app</a>.
              I also work on my application <a href="https://sheeptrick1.azurewebsites.net">SheepsTrick</a>, a web based scoring
              application for the popular mid-west card game "Sheepshead".

              Keeping one's career on a desired trajectory can be difficult.  Sometimes we are simply not in control of the type of work or the tools we use.  I see myself continuing to enhance my abilities as a full-stack developer, cloud developer, and architect.  The best way to do this, in my opinion, is with real world experience.  Do you have an opportunity 
              in an organization that focuses on team-work and continuous learning?  Would the skills I just mentioned be part of the job?  If so, get in touch!
