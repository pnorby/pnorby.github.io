          <h3>Where I've been</h3>
          <div class="text-left">
          <p>My first professional experience was as a .NET Developer at WPS Health Solutions.  I used Visual Studio 2017 to work on a variety of batch applications, Windows Forms integrations, and an API. In this position
            I was also able to obtain my Dell Boomi Professional Developer certificate and work as a citizen developer 
            on some Boomi integrations.  In early 2021 I moved into a Java developer role creating web services, migrating data from DB2 to SQL Server, and generating Stored Procedures based on legacy Cobol programs.
            </p>
            <p>
            I took a position as a contracted Full Stack Developer at Electronic Theater Controls in the fall of 2021.  My responsibilities included maintaining the full stack of multiple C# web applications,
             a legacy Java application, and acting as lead developer for any new enterprise applications that the business requested.

          <h3>What I'm doing</h3>
          <div class="text-left">
            <p>
              I am currently working as a Full Stack Java Software Engineer at Thorne. What a ride it has been so far!  In just a few short months
              I have been exposed to many new tools and frameworks.  These include the Java framework Spring Boot, Vue JS and other JavaScript libraries,
              Rabbit MQ messaging, MySQL and a few AWS services.  Some exciting projects I've worked on include a Shopify app and an integration with Docusign!
            </p>
            <!-- do not expose sheeptrick until its secure Paul...<p>
              Continuous learning is important to me.  Outside of work I continue to enhance my skills in a variety of ways.  I completed JavaScript Frameworks at Madison College in which focused on Angular.  I try and apply the concepts I am learning to my <a href="https://pnorby.github.io/rent-a-car">car-rental demo app</a>.
              I also work on my application <a href="https://sheeptrick1.azurewebsites.net">SheepTrick</a>, a web based scoring
              application for the popular mid-west card game "Sheepshead" hosted in Azure.

          <div class="text-left">
            <p>
              Keeping one's career on a desired trajectory can be difficult.  Sometimes we are simply not in control of the type of work or the tools we use.  I see myself continuing to enhance my abilities as a full-stack developer, cloud developer, and architect.  The best way to do this is with real world experience.  Do you have an opportunity 
              in an organization that focuses on team-work and continuous learning?  Would the skills I just mentioned be part of the job?  If so, get in touch!
