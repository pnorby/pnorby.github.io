		 <h3>JavaScript</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 I took this class first semester.  
		In JavaScript I learned about operators, nested if-else statements,
		booleans, functions, for and while loops, arrays, and using
		JavaScript to alter HTML elements!  I look forward to learning
		about libraries and more advanced techniques!
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>SQL</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 In my second semester SQL class I worked
		with the Oracle 12C SQL textbook by Joan Casteel. I have worked with ERD's,
		data definition language and data manipulation language including, joins, subqueries, and
		single and multi-row functions.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>Intro To Web Development</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 In this first semester class we learned about
		static web pages using the New Perspectives HTML/CSS textbook.  Some things
		covered were block-level and in-line elements, classes, pseudoclasses, lists,  
		and forms.  We also learned how to add CSS to the web page to add spacing,
		color, font style, and sizing among other things.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>Advanced Web Development</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 I took Advanced Web Design early because I enjoyed
		Intro to Web Design so much! In Advanced Web Design I used the same text book but
		mostly online resources such as W3Schools as instructed.  I learned about DDT's, XML,
		bootstrap, mobile responsive design, XSD's and validation.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>Java</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 In my second semester Java course we used
		the Head First Java textbook 2nd Edition.  I learned much about Object Oriented Design
		including encapsulation, using abstract classes, inheritance, interfaces, overloaded constructors,
		and more.  All this was taught with an emphasis on building efficient, reusable code.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>Advanced Java</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 This class was challenging but fun!
		 We learned GIT and ANT commands while using Java 8 API documentation to build an application	
		that takes an input stream, analyzes a .txt file, and then writes a new file detailing certain information
		about that file. We studied different collections in Java to help analyze the tokens of the file.  Towards the end of the semester
	        we learned how to use Java servlets and JSP pages.   See the example in my portfolio section to view the user interface I built!  We developed in a Linux image using TomCat.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>Enterprise Java</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 This class was a favorite of mine.  Using IntelliJ as our IDE, we developed web apps and deployed them to AWS.
		 We used Hibernate as our framework and deployed to an Apache Tomcat web server on an AWS EC2 instance.  Other concepts we touched on included
		 SOAP/RESTful web services, multi-threading, and asynchronous messaging!
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>PHP with MySQL</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 In this second semester course I learned about cookies, session data, 
		self-referencing forms, switch statements, CAPTCHA authentication, RSS Feeds and API's, and MySQL script.
		This includes querying and inserting data into a database.  We use the Head First Php with MySQL text book.
		Also, we have touched on security issues such as SQL injections, and utilizing security features
		such as web-authentication, SHA1, and password_hash.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>Systems Design</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 In Systems Design we learned about how
		software projects are completed while experiencing team dynamics.  We
		created a mock mobile application, and mock software application including a 
		database for a bicycle delivery service.  We touched on agile methods of software delivery
		and how the software development life cycle has changed recently.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>Systems Analysis</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 This class has been very fun so far working in groups to lay out
		what we think would be a good high level view of a score keeping application for foosball.  Just
		recently, we learned about burn-down and burn-up charts so that we can give our best estimation of
		project time lines.  I am excited to keep learning about agile methods and the software development life cycle!
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>ASP.NET</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 ASP.NET was an exciting change from the world of Java!
		We worked on navigating visual studio, setting up our Model View Controller
		architecture, and learned about Object Relational Mappers. We used Entity Framework Core to allow
		a user to enter in different grocery items to be stored in a local database.  Soon you will be able to see the example in my
	        portfolio section.  We also utilized tag helpers in our CSHTML files, used some bootstrap, and implemented seed data in an app.
		 </p>
		 </div>
		 
		 <h3>AJAX using JavaScript</h3>
		 <div>
		 <p>
		 In AJAX I learned more about using JavaScript and JQuery to make dynamic web pages that make the
		 user experience a little more enjoyable.  I used AJAX to call into geonames.org to get weather data for a 
		 user entered zip code.  I am now trying to incorporate some JQuery into this site!
